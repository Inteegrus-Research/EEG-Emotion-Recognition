# EEG-Emotion-Recognition

Collaborative research project on **EEG-based Emotion Recognition** using machine learning and deep learning.  
Our aim is to build a complete open-source pipeline â€” from raw EEG preprocessing to model training and evaluation â€” and extend it toward real-world neurotech applications.

## ðŸ”¹ Project Goals
- Develop a reproducible EEG emotion recognition pipeline  
- Benchmark classical ML (SVM, Random Forest) vs. deep learning (CNN, LSTM, Transformers)  
- Validate across multiple datasets for robustness  
- Publish results in a high-impact journal/conference  
- Create a foundation for future hardware integration with low-cost EEG headsets  

## ðŸ”¹ Datasets
We will use **publicly available datasets** for transparency and reproducibility:
- [DEAP Dataset](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/)  
- [DREAMER Dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/546113)  
- [SEED Dataset](https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~seed/)  

*Note: some datasets may require request/approval before access.*

## ðŸ”¹ Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.9+  
- ML/DL: PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn  
- Signal Processing: MNE, SciPy, NumPy  
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## ðŸ”¹ Repository Structure
- `/datasets/` â€“ scripts & links to datasets  
- `/preprocessing/` â€“ EEG cleaning, filtering, normalization  
- `/models/` â€“ CNN, LSTM, Transformer architectures  
- `/notebooks/` â€“ Jupyter exploration and experiments  
- `/results/` â€“ evaluation metrics, plots  
- `/utils/` â€“ helper functions (data loaders, metrics)  
- `requirements.txt` â€“ Python dependencies  
- `README.md` â€“ project overview  

## ðŸ”¹ Collaboration Workflow
- Version control: GitHub (branches, pull requests, issues)  
- Communication: Zoom, Slack/Discord (as needed)  
- Tasks: Managed via GitHub Issues and Projects board  

## ðŸ”¹ Expected Outcomes
- Open-source EEG emotion recognition pipeline  
- Cross-dataset benchmark results (ML vs. DL)  
- Research paper draft for joint submission (Elsevier/Springer journal)  
- Future pathway: integration with Emotiv / OpenBCI devices
